# Funhouse Malatang

Redesign of website for Funhouse Malatang, a chain malatang restaurant in Sydney that I visit too often to admit ðŸ˜…

Written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Note

This is part of The Odin Project's "Full Stack JavaScript" course. This project is focused specifically on using Webpack, as well as ES6 Modules.

The code is structured such that, on click of the `<nav>` buttons, vanilla JavaScript files will run and output each of the pages to the DOM. The `<header>` and `<footer>` remain constant.
